            "One night Rasa’s grandmother — the woman who raised him — catches them in bed together. The following day Rasa is consumed by the search for his best friend Maj, a fiery activist and drag queen star of the underground bar, Guapa, who has been arrested by the police.",
            "Equally astute in its analysis of Arab and American mores, the book’s characters are nuanced and dynamic; it gives fresh life to the maxim ‘the personal is political.’” —The Guardian “Guapa challenges the notion of what a ‘conventional’ love story should look like, and as one of few queer novels with an Arab protagonist, it must not be overlooked.",
            "Haddad has woven together a fascinating story with elements of a life richly lived, and if Guapa finds its way into the canon of queer literature, we will all be stronger for it.” —Lambda Literary “Those looking for a nuanced portrait of gay life in the modern Middle East will find plenty to admire in this…promising debut.” —Kirkus Reviews “Haddad presents a striking look at gay life, the psychological cost of conformity, and what it means to be true to yourself from a Middle Eastern perspective.” —Booklist “Warmly recommended to all readers who are interested in issues of diversity and the Middle East.” —Library Journal “A remarkable debut.” —The Huffington Post “Haddad’s unwavering dedication to detail, narrative arc, and consequence make Guapa necessarily poignant, uncomfortable, and meaningful."

            "One night Rasa's grandmother—the woman who raised him—catches them in bed together. The following day Rasa is consumed by the search for his best friend Maj, a fiery activist and drag queen star of the underground bar, Guapa, who has been arrested by the police.",

Rasa is a young gay man in an \"unnamed Arab country\" who is grappling with a complicated relationship, his grandmother, living a closeted life, and his place in the political turmoil his country is facing.",
            "For the rest of Guapa, we follow Rasa throughout a 24-hour period filled with political and personal unrest: both the uprising of the Arab Spring protests and the uprising of Rasa’s heart when he realizes he may never be with the man he loves. In interspersed flashbacks, we see Rasa’s tumultuous childhood growing up in a household rife with conflict, his time studying in the United States as a college student, as well as the development of his queer identity."

              "text": "<html><body><p>\"Guapa\", in its more common sense, means \"pretty\", beautiful\" and it is indeed used as a compliment. As such, it can be used in several ways.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It <em>can</em> be used in a friendly way. I myself use it with my female friends now and then just to cheer them up, especially when first greeting them:  \n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>(FRIEND)—¡Hola walen! Dile a tu mujer que ayer se dejó aquí el chaquetón. (ME)—¡Hola guapa! Claro, se lo diré. ¡Gracias!</em><br/>\n  (FRIEND)—Hi walen! Tell your wife she left her coat here yesterday. (ME)—Hi pretty! Sure, I'll tell her. Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n<p>       In this sense, it is maybe akin to \"honey\", as in \"Hi honey!\", though I'm not sure if that's considered \"friendly\" either in e.g. US culture.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can be used in a neutral way, i.e. literally tell someone that she is beautiful:  \n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>—¿Qué tal me queda este vestido? —Muy bien, estás muy guapa.</em><br/>\n  —How do I look in this dress? —Very good, you look beautiful.</p>\n<p><em>—No sé si pasaré la audición. —Seguro que sí: eres guapa, cantas realmente bien... Se pelearán por ti.</em><br/>\n  — I don't know if I'll pass the audition. —Sure you'll do: you're beautiful, you sing really good... They'll fight over you.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n<p>       (Notice that we say \"estás guapa\" to mean someone <em>looks</em> beautiful, or \"eres guapa\" to mean someone <em>is</em> beautiful.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>And of course, it <em>can</em> be used to hit on someone:  \n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>—¡Hola! ¿Qué hace una chica tan guapa aquí sola?</em><br/>\n  —Hi! What's such a beautiful girl doing here all alone?</p>\n<p><em>—Ayer estabas muy guapa, no se me va tu imagen de la cabeza.</em><br/>\n  —You looked very beautiful last night, I can't get your image out of my head.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, to answer your question: <strong>yes, \"guapa\" <em>can</em> be used in a friendly way, but that is not the only way it is used.</strong></p>\n<p>Sadly, the intention behind a compliment is kind of outside the scope of this forum.  </p></body></html>",

            "When I first arrived in Spain, I had several men (and a few women) say to me “Guapa“. Both as I walked past them in the street, and when I was buying something in a shop or ordering a drink at a bar — “Hola, Guapa!”.",
            "I soon found out Guapa, (or Guapo, if the word is said to a man), means ‘Beautiful’ or ‘Handsome’ in English. It can also be used to simply mean ‘Hot’.",
            "Don’t forget too, like most Spanish adjectives, Guapa is easy to use, and can be used in hundreds of different sentences, or even just on its own as an exclamation, “Guapa!”.",
            "And, if you want to see how Guapa/Guapo is used to talk about someone being ‘hot’, check out the excellent video from Butterfly Spanish for an explanation below."
